# House Price Prediction System

This repository provides a house price prediction system that estimates the value of a house based on various factors. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical house sales data and identify key features that influence pricing.

# Features:

# Machine Learning Algorithms:
Supports different algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for accurate prediction.
Users can select or experiment with different algorithms to find the best fit for their data.
# Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values, outliers, and data cleaning to ensure model quality.
Feature engineering may be applied to create additional informative features from the data (e.g., neighborhood quality score based on amenities).
# Evaluation:
Employs standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
Provides clear visualizations of results to aid in model evaluation and improvement.
# Scalability:
Considers strategies like dimensionality reduction or distributed computing to scale the system for larger datasets (if applicable).
